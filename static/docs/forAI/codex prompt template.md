# [Short Task Title]

You are modifying an existing SvelteKit application.  
Use JavaScript only. DO NOT analyze. DO NOT explain.

---

## Objective
Describe exactly what should be achieved.
Include a clear success condition that can be verified in the UI or behavior.

---

## Context
Explain where the change takes place:
- Page / component name
- Existing features that must remain untouched
- Relevant data structures or state variables

---

## Task
List the required changes in strict, step-by-step order.
Each step should describe:
- What to add
- Where to add it
- What it must do

Avoid abstract wording. Be concrete.

---

## Constraints (VERY IMPORTANT)
Explicitly forbid unwanted behavior:
- Do NOT refactor existing logic
- Do NOT rename variables
- Do NOT change backend behavior
- Do NOT modify unrelated UI
- Do NOT introduce new abstractions

State exactly what must NOT be done.

---

## Verification
Describe how success can be checked manually:
- What should be visible?
- What interactions should work?
- What must remain unchanged?

---

## Execution
EXECUTE THE CODE CHANGES DIRECTLY.
